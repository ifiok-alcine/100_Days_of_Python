## Day 8

This day covered how to use funtions with inputs. Previously we had learnt about using just plain functions but with functions that can take in input you can customise what the function  will do based on the input. 
We also learnt about positional and  keyword arguments, and which might be suited for a particular function.

The day's project was building a caesar cipher program that can encode and decode a message sent based on a particlar shift number.
