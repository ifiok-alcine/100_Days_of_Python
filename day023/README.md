## Day 23

The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project
Today was a capstone project about making a turtle crossing game where the goal is to reach the other side of the road admist moving cars. 
I was able to create the player and scoreboard objects on my own but i could not solve how to create the moving cars by myself.
